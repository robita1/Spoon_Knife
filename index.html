  <h1>How To Use These Exercises</h1>
<ol>    <!-- this ordered list contains 6 lists within it it contains unordered list for each list except for list number 2 which doesn't contain unordered list.-->
    <li>Fork and clone this repository. To learn how to fork a repository, see the GitHub documentation on how 
      to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo"> <span class = "repo"> fork a repo. </span></a> </li>
        <ul>
      <li>Copies of repositories on your machine are called clones. If you need help cloning to your local environment, you can learn how from the GitHub documentation on <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository" class="new-link"> cloning a repository.</a></li>
        </ul>
    <li>Go to an exercise directory and open the HTML file in a web browser. You can open the file directly or use something like VSCode's Live Server extension.</li>
    <li>For each exercise, read the README thoroughly before starting any work.</li>
      <ul>
      <li>Each README has a "Self Check" list. Use this to ensure you haven't missed any important details in your implementation.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Make your edits in the <span class="index-html">index.html</span> and/or the <span class="style-css">style.css</span> files in order to make the output 
      in your browser look like the Desired Outcome image(s).</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Depending on the instructions of the exercise, you may only need to make edits in one of these files.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Once you successfully finish an exercise, check TOP's solution to compare it with yours.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>You should not be checking the solution for an exercise until you finish it!</li>
        <li>If your solution differs wildly from TOP's solution (and still passes the exercise's requirements), 
        that's completely fine. Do feel free to ask about it in our Discord if there are parts you do not understand.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Do not submit your solutions to this repo, as any PRs that do so will be closed without merging.</li>
</ol>
